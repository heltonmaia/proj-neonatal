### **Pose Estimation Keypoints (Based on COCO with Mouth Addition)**

This project implements a human pose estimation keypoint annotation system based on the COCO dataset format, with the inclusion of the **mouth** as an additional 18th keypoint. The keypoints represent important anatomical landmarks used for detecting and analyzing human body poses in images or videos. These annotations are suitable for training machine learning models in tasks such as action recognition, human tracking, gesture control, and augmented reality.

The full list of keypoints used in this project is as follows:

1. Nose
2. Left eye
3. Right eye
4. Left ear
5. Right ear
6. Left shoulder
7. Right shoulder
8. Left elbow
9. Right elbow
10. Left wrist
11. Right wrist
12. Left hip
13. Right hip
14. Left knee
15. Right knee
